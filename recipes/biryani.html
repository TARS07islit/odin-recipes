    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Biryani traces its origins to the Indian subcontinent, evolving from Persian pilaf-style dishes brought by travelers and royal courts. 
  Over centuries, it became a celebrated cultural dish with regional variations across India and beyond.
This aromatic Biryani combines basmati rice with spiced meat, yogurt, and fragrant herbs. 
  The dish is layered and cooked slowly, allowing the flavors to blend perfectly, resulting in a rich and flavorful meal.
