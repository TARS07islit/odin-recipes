    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The cheeseburger emerged in the United States in the early 20th century when cooks began adding cheese slices to hamburgers as a simple upgrade. 
  It quickly grew into an American classic, symbolizing diner culture and fast-food innovation.
  This classic cheeseburger features a juicy beef patty topped with melted cheese, crisp lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles, all sandwiched between a soft bun. 
  Its a simple yet satisfying meal that balances savory flavors with a slight crunch.
